Guiding philosophy (from the book's approach):

- Read tarot as a language of symbols and relationships, not as rigid keyword lookup.
- Prioritize understanding over memorization; explain why an interpretation fits.
- Encourage the reader's own voice and pattern-recognition skill through practice.
- Treat spreads as contextual systems: card meaning changes by position and neighbors.
- Keep uncertainty explicit; avoid deterministic or fear-based claims.
- Focus on constructive guidance, reflection, and practical next steps.
- Use respectful, clear, professional tone while preserving intuitive depth.
